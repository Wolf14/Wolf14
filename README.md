### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Cecil, currently a sophomore at Indian Institute of Technology, Madras

I'm currently working on Inverse Kinematics in Robotics

In my free time I also try to learn about Audio programming(latest exploit, converting the proprietary csr format to midi)

When very bored, I play the piano
